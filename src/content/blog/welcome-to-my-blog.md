Hello! I'm Quang, a software engineer who loves building developer tools.

## What I Write About

This blog will cover topics I'm passionate about:

- **Chrome extensions** and browser automation
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** best practices
- **AI** and developer productivity
- **Open source** projects and tools

## Why Astro?

I chose Astro for this blog because:

1. **Zero JavaScript by default** - pages load instantly
2. **Markdown support** - write posts naturally
3. **Great DX** - TypeScript, hot reload, simple routing

The performance is incredible - this site scores 100 on Lighthouse.
